**Project Overview**

This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates the fare of a trip based on key features such as pickup/dropoff location, distance, duration, and time of day. The goal is to deliver accurate fare predictions beneficial for users, drivers, and pricing analysis.

**Features**

- Data ingestion, cleaning, and feature engineering

- Trip fare prediction using regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

- Evaluation of model performance via MAE, RMSE, and RÂ²

**Tech Stack**

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikitâ€‘learn, matplotlib/seaborn)

- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Regressor / XGBoost / LightGBM

- **Model Persistence**: Pickle
